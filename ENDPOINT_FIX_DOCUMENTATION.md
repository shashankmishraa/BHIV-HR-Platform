# ðŸ”§ Gateway API Endpoint Fix - Client Refresh Issue

## Issue Resolution

**Problem**: During Render deployment, the system attempted to call `GET /v1/client/refresh`, but the server returned "405 Method Not Allowed" because the endpoint only accepted POST requests.

**Root Cause**: The client portal was making POST requests to `/v1/client/refresh`, but during deployment or certain network conditions, these requests were being converted to GET requests.

**Solution**: Added both GET and POST methods for critical client endpoints to ensure compatibility across all deployment scenarios.

## Fixed Endpoints

### 1. Client Token Refresh
- **POST /v1/client/refresh** - Original endpoint (maintained for compatibility)
- **GET /v1/client/refresh** - New endpoint to handle GET requests during deployment

### 2. Client Logout  
- **POST /v1/client/logout** - Original endpoint (maintained for compatibility)
- **GET /v1/client/logout** - New endpoint to handle GET requests during deployment

## Deployment Verification

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test both refresh methods
curl -X POST https://bhiv-hr-gateway.onrender.com/v1/client/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"refresh_token": "refresh_token_TECH001_1234567890"}'

curl -X GET "https://bhiv-hr-gateway.onrender.com/v1/client/refresh?refresh_token=refresh_token_TECH001_1234567890"

# Test both logout methods  
curl -X POST https://bhiv-hr-gateway.onrender.com/v1/client/logout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

curl -X GET https://bhiv-hr-gateway.onrender.com/v1/client/logout
```

### Expected Responses
Both GET and POST methods should return:
```json
{
  "message": "Token refreshed successfully",
  "access_token": "client_token_TECH001_1234567890",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token_TECH001_1234567890", 
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

## Client Portal Compatibility

The client portal (`services/client_portal/app.py`) will continue to use POST requests by default, but the gateway now supports both methods for maximum compatibility during deployment.

## Files Modified

1. **`services/gateway/app/main.py`** - Added GET methods for refresh and logout endpoints
2. **`ENDPOINT_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - This documentation file

## Deployment Status

- âœ… **Gateway API**: 48 endpoints (2 new GET methods added)
- âœ… **Client Portal**: Compatible with both GET/POST methods
- âœ… **Render Deployment**: Should resolve 405 Method Not Allowed errors
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: All existing POST endpoints maintained

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated gateway to Render
2. Test both GET and POST refresh endpoints
3. Verify client portal authentication flow
4. Monitor deployment logs for any remaining 405 errors
