# Security Fixes - CWE-798 Resolution

## Issue: Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798)

### Problem
- Demo API key `myverysecureapikey123` was exposed in documentation
- Hardcoded credentials create security vulnerabilities
- Anyone with access to docs could access the system

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Secure API Key Management
- Created `security_config.py` with `SecureAPIKeyManager`
- Validates API keys are not demo/hardcoded values
- Generates cryptographically secure API keys

#### 2. Environment Variable Enforcement
- Strict validation of `API_KEY_SECRET` environment variable
- Rejects known demo/hardcoded keys
- Provides clear error messages for security violations

#### 3. Security Validation
- Added `scripts/security_check.py` for automated scanning
- Detects hardcoded credentials in codebase
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline

#### 4. Secure Configuration Template
- Created `.env.template` with secure defaults
- Guidance on generating secure API keys
- Clear separation of development/production configs

### Usage

#### Generate Secure API Key
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

#### Set Environment Variable
```bash
export API_KEY_SECRET="your_secure_generated_key_here"
```

#### Run Security Check
```bash
python scripts/security_check.py
```

### Security Best Practices Applied

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All credentials from environment variables
2. **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random keys
3. **Validation**: Automatic detection of insecure patterns
4. **Documentation**: Clear guidance on secure configuration
5. **Monitoring**: Automated security scanning capability

### Impact
- ✅ CWE-798 vulnerability resolved
- ✅ Production-ready security implementation
- ✅ Automated security validation
- ✅ Clear security guidelines for developers
